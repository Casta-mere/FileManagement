So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. â€“ F. Scott Fitzgerald

oh oh sometime, I get a good feeling, yeah
get a feeling that I never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

I used to roll the dice, feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing, "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key, next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

never forget who you are, the rest of the world will not, wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you
have a test
